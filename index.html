       <h1>Story za Tulley</h1>
       <p>this is a test</p>
       <p>ghengis khan conqueror of asia 
        he was a military leader who launched a series of campaigns
        The principal source of steppe wealth was post-battle plunder, 
        of which a leader would normally claim a large share; Genghis eschewed this custom, 
        choosing instead to divide booty equally between himself and all his men.
        Disliking any form of luxury, he extolled the simple life of the nomad in a letter to Changchun 
        and objected to being addressed with obsequious flattery. 
        He encouraged his companions to address him informally, give him advice, 
        and criticise his mistakes.[193] Genghis's openness to criticism and willingness to 
        learn saw him seeking the knowledge of family members, companions, neighbouring states,
        and enemies.[194] He sought and gained knowledge of sophisticated weaponry from China and the Muslim world, 
        appropriated the Uyghur alphabet with the help of the captured scribe Tata-tonga, 
        and employed numerous specialists across legal, commercial, and administrative fields.
        He also understood the need for a smooth succession and showed good judgement in choosing his heir.

       <blockquote>Having attained control over one million people,[
        76] Genghis Khan began what May has termed a "social revolution".[77] 
        As traditional tribal systems had primarily evolved to benefit small clans and families, they were unsuitable as
         the foundations for larger states and 
         had been the downfall of previous steppe confederations.
